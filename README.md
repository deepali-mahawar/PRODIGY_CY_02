Task-02: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
This project aims to develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. It leverages techniques such as swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel, providing a foundation for exploring image security through pixel-level manipulation.

Features:

Encryption: Encrypts images using specified pixel manipulation methods.
Decryption: Decrypts images back to their original state.
User-friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface allows users to easily select images, choose encryption methods, and view the encrypted/decrypted results.
How it Works:

The project utilizes various methods for pixel manipulation, including:

Swapping: Exchanging pixel values based on a predefined pattern or algorithm.
Basic Mathematical Operations: Applying arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) to pixel values.
Potential Applications:

Basic Image Security: Provides a starting point for exploring image encryption techniques.
Educational Tool: Offers a hands-on learning experience for understanding pixel manipulation and its applications.
Image Processing Research: Serves as a foundation for more advanced image manipulation techniques and security algorithms.
